Hello, my name is Lee Wei. I currently work at <a href="www.oromico.com">Oromico</a> as a Product/UX Designer. 
Previously, I worked at another startup called Homekoala. At Homekoala, we developed a real-estate search engine for properties in Australia. 
However, we could not continue the project as we did not find a way to monetise it. 
It was at Homekoala where I realised the importance of focusing on design for the needs of the business.

I started on the path of design relatively late into my twenties, although i’ve always had a keen interest in it since 
my teenage years. After a series of fortunate missteps, I eventually stumbled back into design and realised this is where I’m most comfortable at.


Feel free to reach out to me at leewei@live.com.sg if you wish to have a chat.
