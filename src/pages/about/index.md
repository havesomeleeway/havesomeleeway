Hello, my name is Lee Wei. I currently work at <a href="www.oromico.com">Oromico</a> as a Product/UX Designer. We're focused on unstructured financial data processing, thereby empowering everyone to gain a better understanding of their financial position. 


Previously, I worked at another startup called Homekoala. At Homekoala, we developed a real-estate search engine for properties in Australia. However, we had to call it quits after two years as we failed to find a way to monetise it. After those two years, I learnt many important lessons which I carry till today. We focused too much time on developing features, in hopes that the next 'great' feature would bring us to the place that we needed to be. Yet in hindsight, more time should have been spent on getting actual paying customers onboard. 



Feel free to reach out to me at leewei@live.com.sg if you wish to have a chat.
